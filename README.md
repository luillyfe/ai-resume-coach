# 🚀 CV AI Coach: Your Personal Resume Guru

## 🎭 The Elevator Pitch

Imagine having a seasoned tech recruiter, a sharp-eyed editor, and a Silicon Valley insider all rolled into one, ready to scrutinize your CV 24/7. That's CV AI Coach for you! We're not just another resume checker – we're your secret weapon in the cut-throat tech job market.

## 🧠 What's Under the Hood?

At the heart of CV AI Coach lies a powerful AI brain, fueled by Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro. It's like having GPT's cooler, more focused cousin dedicated solely to making your CV shine. Here's the secret sauce:

1. **PDF Whisperer**: We speak fluent PDF. Upload your resume, and we'll extract every juicy detail.
2. **AI Magnifying Glass**: Our Gemini-powered algorithm dissects your CV with the precision of a surgeon and the creativity of a poet.
3. **Markdown Magician**: Feedback so beautifully formatted, you'll want to frame it. (But please don't – update your CV instead!)

## 🛠 Tech Stack Lowdown

- **Next.js**: Because we believe in living on the edge... of web technology.
- **React**: For UI smoothness that'll make you go "Oooh!"
- **Ant Design**: Our secret to looking good without trying too hard.
- **Google Gemini API**: The brains of the operation. Don't tell GPT, but we think Gemini's got an edge when it comes to CV analysis.

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/cv-ai-coach.git`
2. **Install dependencies**: `npm install` (or `yarn install` if you're fancy)
3. **Set up your environment**:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   ```
   (Don't have a Gemini API key? Time to make friends at Google!)
4. **Fire it up**: `npm run dev`
5. **Upload your CV**: And watch the magic happen!

## 🎨 Customization: Make It Yours

Want to tweak the AI prompts? Fancy a different UI? Go wild! The code is your oyster. Just remember:

- The AI prompt lives in `LLM.tsx`. Adjust it to focus on specific industries or roles.
- UI components are in `Feedback.tsx`. Feel free to jazz it up!

## 🤓 For the Nerds

- We're using Next.js App Router. It's new, it's shiny, and it's fast!
- Server-side functions handle the heavy lifting, keeping your client lean and mean.
- We've got TypeScript sprinkled throughout because we believe in catching errors before they catch you off guard.
